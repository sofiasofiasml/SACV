1
00:00:00,847 --> 00:00:01,847
Take me somewhere

2
00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:03,498
So when do I see you again?

3
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:04,306
What are you doing on Thursday night?

4
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:05,361
My neighbor, Bette... she's having a thingamajiggy.

5
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,139
What?

6
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:09,243
I have something on Thursday.

7
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,623
- Really? -
Yeah - Fuck

8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:17,288
If she asked me today, I would say no.

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:26,089
I would.
- You would?

10
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:30,317
Yes.

11
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:39,516
I have a date tonight.
- Oh, you do? - I do.

12
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:45,291
What?
- I'm a little jealous.

13
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,291
You are? That's good.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,890
Yeah, it is.

15
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:60,116
Stop.
